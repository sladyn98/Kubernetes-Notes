# Kubernetes Notes


## Kubernetes Architecture 

At the hardware level, a Kubernetes cluster
is composed of many nodes, which can be split into two types:
 * The master node, which hosts the Kubernetes Control Plane that controls and manages the whole Kubernetes system

*  Worker nodes that run the actual applications you deploy


# Resources
